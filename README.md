## Introduction to CNNs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They have revolutionized the field of computer vision, enabling machines to recognize and understand visual data with unprecedented accuracy.

## Architecture Overview

This repository will contain various CNN architectures implemented using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Each architecture will be thoroughly documented, including explanations of its design choices, implementation details, and performance evaluations on benchmark datasets.

## Google Colab Notebooks

Instead of cloning this repository, you can directly access and run the CNN architecture implementations using Google Colab notebooks. Simply click on the links provided in each architecture's README to open the corresponding Colab notebook. From there, you can execute the code, experiment with different parameters, and visualize the results without needing to download any files.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to add a new architecture, improve existing implementations, or fix bugs, please feel free to submit pull requests. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

If you have any ideas, suggestions, or feedback, don't hesitate to open an issue. This repository aims to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing in the field of computer vision.
